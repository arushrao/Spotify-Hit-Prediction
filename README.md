# Spotify-Hit-Prediction

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Spotify has become one of the top streaming providers in the Music industry. It has become considerably difficult for the management to decide what record labels and artists should be offered a contract and the kind of music or artists that should be promoted via paid advertisements and whether their music should be part of their free or premium service. 
The goal of this project was to predict whether a song is popular or not based on the song attributes(Metadata) and genre that Spotify provides. We ran an analysis on about approximately 6000 hit and non-hit songs to help understand what makes a song popular and if we could predict whether it will be on the Top 100 Billboard or not.
